                <h3 id="lactose">Do the Shome products contain lactose or gluten?</h3>
                <p>
                    All Shome Bakery products are 100% plant-based and therefore dairy free, naturally lactose-free and free from animal protein.
                    The majority of the products are also gluten free. Always check the ingredient lists on the package for the most recent and detailed information.

                <h3 id="thickener">Does Shome Bakery use stabilisers and thickeners? </h3>
                <p>Yes, ice cream needs to be velvety, desserts have to hug the spoon and linger in the mouth. Basically, we want our foods to taste as good as at the moment we made them. That�s where stabilisers and thickeners come in, helping our desserts stay deliciously thick, every time you take them out of the fridge. The stabiliser and thickener use by Shome Bakery are guar gum, pectin, locust bean gum, xanthan gum and much more.</p><hr />

                <p>Yes, the colouring used is entirely of colours from natural plant-based foods. So we add a few drops of (natural) colourings or food extracts to restore any colour lost in cooking or to add a little extra zing to your dessert. For example, anthocyanins, caratenes ,curcumin and etc.</p><hr />
